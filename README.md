Calmind ("we," "us," or "our") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application Calmind (the "App"). Please read this policy carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it.

1. Information We Collect
Calmind is designed to be privacy-friendly and does not collect or store any personally identifiable information (PII) from users. All data related to your meditation sessions, music preferences, and app usage is stored locally on your device and is never transmitted to any servers.

2. Use of Data
Since we do not collect any personal information, we do not use, share, or sell your data to any third parties. Your app experience is entirely private and confined to your device.

3. Log Data
Like many app developers, we may collect non-personal information automatically through standard analytics tools provided by the device's operating system to improve app performance and stability. This information may include your device's Internet Protocol (IP) address, device model, operating system version, and crash reports. This data is anonymous and used solely to enhance the user experience.

4. Cookies and Tracking Technologies
Our app does not use cookies, tracking pixels, or any similar tracking technologies.

5. Security
We take the security of your data seriously. Since all your data remains on your device, it is protected by your device's security measures. We recommend that you keep your device secure by using passwords, biometric locks, or other safety features.

6. Children's Privacy
Calmind is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13. If we learn that we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete that information as soon as possible.

7. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect changes in our practices or for legal, operational, or regulatory reasons. We encourage you to review this policy regularly. When we update the policy, we will revise the "Effective Date" at the top of this document.

8. Your Rights
Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have certain rights regarding your personal data, such as access, correction, or deletion. Since we do not collect personal data, these rights do not apply to Calmind. However, you always have the option to uninstall the app and delete all data stored on your device.
